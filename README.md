# deugue-risk-Undergrad-Project
This project was part of my undergraduate research in the UCLab at National Cheng Kung University, under the guidance of Professor Xun-Ping Chieh, in collaboration with the Tainan City Government. The study focused on leveraging ovitrap data collected across urban areas to monitor the egg counts and positivity rates of dengue vector mosquitoes. Combined with multivariate weather data from local meteorological stations (temperature, pressure, wind direction, humidity, etc.), we developed a spatiotemporal forecasting model. The results aimed to provide actionable insights for effective vector control and local public health interventions.
